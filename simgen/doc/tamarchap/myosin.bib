Elastic network potentials for the beginning and end states of a transition are combined, in effect, by adding their respective partition functions. The resulting effective MENM energy function smoothly interpolates between the original surfaces, and retains the beginning and end structures as local minima. Saddle points, transition paths, potentials of mean force, and partition functions can be found efficiently by largely analytic methods. To characterize the protein motions during a conformational transition, we follow 'transition paths' on the MENM surface that connect the beginning and end structures and are invariant to parameterizations of the model and the mathematical form of the mixing scheme. As illustrations of the general formalism, we study large-scale conformation changes of the motor proteins KIF1A kinesin and myosin II. We generate possible transition paths for these two proteins that reveal details of their conformational motions. The MENM formalism is computationally efficient and generally applicable even for large protein systems that undergo highly collective structural changes. Proteins 2007. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

The repertoire of adapter proteins that link myoV to a particular cargo is becoming better understood, enabling cellular transport processes to be dissected. MyoV is processive, meaning that it takes many steps on actin filaments without dissociating. Its extended lever arm results in long 36-nm steps, making it ideal for single molecule studies of processive movement. In addition, electron microscopy revealed the structure of the inactive, folded conformation of myoV when it is not transporting cargo. This review provides a background on myoV, and highlights recent discoveries that show why myoV will continue to be an active focus of investigation."

Although this is generally thought to involve movement of a mechanical lever arm attached to a motor core, the structural details of the rearrangement in myosin that drive the lever arm motion on actin attachment are unknown. Motivated by kinetic evidence that the processive unconventional myosin, myosin V, populates a unique state in the absence of nucleotide and actin, we obtained a 2.0 A structure of a myosin V fragment. Here we reveal a conformation of myosin without bound nucleotide. The nucleotide-binding site has adopted new conformations of the nucleotide-binding elements that reduce the affinity for the nucleotide. The major cleft in the molecule has closed, and the lever arm has assumed a position consistent with that in an actomyosin rigor complex. These changes have been accomplished by relative movements of the subdomains of the molecule, and reveal elements of the structural communication between the actin-binding interface and nucleotide-binding site of myosin that underlie the mechanism of chemo-mechanical transduction."

First, a motor domain structure demonstrates that nucleotide-free myosin V adopts a specific state (rigor-like) that is not influenced by crystal packing. A second structure reveals an actomyosin state that favors rapid release of ADP, and differs from the rigor-like state by a P-loop rearrangement. Comparison of these structures with a third structure, a 2.0 angstroms resolution structure of the motor bound to an ATP analog, illuminates the structural features that provide communication between the actin interface and nucleotide-binding site. Paramount among these is a region we name the transducer, which is composed of the seven-stranded beta-sheet and associated loops and linkers. Reminiscent of the beta-sheet distortion of the F1-ATPase, sequential distortion of this transducer region likely controls sequential release of products from the nucleotide pocket during force generation."

This motor moves processively along its actin track in discrete 36-nm steps. Our model is that one head of the two-headed myosin V tightly binds to actin and swings its long lever arm through a large angle, providing a stroke. We created single-headed constructs with different-size lever arms and show that stroke size is proportional to lever arm length. In a two-headed molecule, the stroke provides the directional bias, after which the unbound head diffuses to find its binding site, 36 nm forward. Our two-headed construct with all six light chains per head reconstitutes the 36-nm processive step seen in tissue-purified myosin V. Two-headed myosin V molecules with only four light chains per head are still processive, but their step size is reduced to 24 nm. A further reduction in the length of the lever arms to one light chain per head results in a motor that is unable to walk processively. This motor produces single small approximately 6-nm strokes, and ATPase and pyrene actin quench measurements show that only one of the heads of this dimer rapidly binds to actin for a given binding event. These data show that for myosin V with its normal proximal tail domain, both heads and a long lever arm are required for large, processive steps."

To further investigate how myosin V moves processively on actin filaments, we altered the length of the neck by adding or deleting IQ motifs in myosin constructs lacking the globular tail domain. These myosin V IQ mutants were fluorescently labeled by exchange of a single Cy3-labeled calmodulin into the neck region of one head. We measured the step-size of these individual IQ mutants with nanometer precision and subsecond resolution using FIONA. The step-size was proportional to neck length for constructs containing 2, 4, 6, and 8 IQ motifs, providing strong support for the swinging lever-arm model of myosin motility. In addition, the kinetics of stepping provided additional support for the hand-over-hand model whereby the two heads alternately assume the leading position. Interestingly, the 8IQ myosin V mutant gave a broad distribution of step-sizes with multiple peaks, suggesting that this mutant has many choices of binding sites on an actin filament. These data demonstrate that the step-size of myosin V is affected by the length of its neck and is not solely determined by the pseudo-repeat of the actin filament."

This processive behavior requires specific adaptations of motor enzymology to meet these unique physiologic demands. One of these involves the ability of the two heads of a processive motor to communicate their structural states to each other. In this study, we examine a processive motor from the myosin superfamily myosin V. We have measured the kinetics of nucleotide release, of phosphate release, and of the weak-to-strong transition, as this motor interacts with actin, and we have used these studies to develop a model of how myosin V functions as a transport motor. Surprisingly, both heads release phosphate rapidly upon the initial encounter with an actin filament, suggesting that there is little or no intramolecular strain associated with this step. However, ADP release can be affected by both forward and rearward strain, and under steady-state conditions it is essentially prevented in the lead head until the rear head detaches. Many of these features are remarkably like those underlying the processive movement of kinesin on microtubules, supporting our hypothesis that different molecular motors satisfy the requirement for processive movement in similar ways, regardless of their particular family of origin."

Here, we examine how two identical heads coordinate their activity to produce efficient hand-over-hand stepping. We have used a modified laser-trap microscope to apply a approximately 2-pN forward or backward force on a single-headed myosin V molecule, hypothesized to simulate forces experienced by the rear or lead head, respectively. We found that pulling forward produces only a small change in the kinetics, whereas pulling backward induces a large reduction in the cycling of the head.

Here, we have used an optical-tweezers-based transducer to measure the effect of load on the mechanical interactions between rabbit skeletal F-actin and a single head of mouse brain myosin-V, which produces its working stroke in two phases. We found that the lifetimes of the first phase of the working stroke changed exponentially and about 10-fold over a range of pushing and pulling forces of +/- 1.5 pN. Stiffness measurements suggest that intramolecular forces could approach 3.6 pN when both heads are bound to F-actin, in which case extrapolation would predict the detachment kinetics of the front head to slow down 50-fold and the kinetics of the rear head to accelerate respectively. This synchronizing effect on the chemo-mechanical cycles of the heads increases the probability of the trail head detaching first and causes a strong increase in the number of forward steps per diffusional encounter over a system with no strain dependence."

In the present study we assessed the structural features that affect processive run length by analyzing the properties of chimeras of mouse myosin V and a non-processive class V myosin from yeast (Myo4p) (Reck-Peterson, S. L., Tyska, M. J., Novick, P. J., and Mooseker, M. S. (2001) J. Cell Biol. 153, 1121-1126). Surprisingly a chimera containing the yeast motor domain on the neck and rod of mouse myosin V (Y-MD) showed longer run lengths than mouse wild type at low salt. Run lengths of mouse myosin V showed little salt dependence, whereas those of Y-MD decreased steeply with ionic strength, similar to a chimera containing yeast loop 2 in the mouse myosin V backbone. Loop 2 binds to acidic patches on actin in the weak binding states of the cycle (Volkmann, N., Liu, H., Hazelwood, L., Krementsova, E. B., Lowey, S., Trybus, K. M., and Hanein, D. (2005) Mol. Cell 19, 595-605). Constructs containing yeast loop 2, which has no net charge compared with +6 for wild type, showed a higher Km for actin in steady-state ATPase assays. The results imply that a positively charged loop 2 and a high affinity for actin are important to maintain processivity near physiologic ionic strength.",

Phosphate dissociation from myosin V-ADP-Pi (inorganic phosphate) and actomyosin V-ADP-Pi and the rate of the hydrolysis step (myosin V-ATP-->myosin V-ADP-Pi) were all approximately 10-fold slower in the S217A mutant than in wild type (WT) myosin V, resulting in a slower steady-state rate of basal and filamentous actin (actin)-activated ATP hydrolysis. Substrate binding and ADP dissociation kinetics were all similar to or slightly faster in S217A than in WT myosin V and mechanochemical gating of the rates of dissociation of ADP between trail and lead heads is maintained. The reduction in the rate constants of the hydrolysis and phosphate dissociation steps reduces the duty ratio from approximately 0.85 in WT myosin V to approximately 0.25 in S217A and produces a motor in which the average run length on actin at physiological concentrations of ATP is reduced 10-fold. Thus we demonstrate that, by mutational perturbation of the switch 1 structure, myosin V can be converted into a low duty ratio motor that is processive only at low substrate concentrations."

It moves processively by 36-nm steps that require at least one of the two heads to be tightly bound to actin throughout the catalytic cycle. To elucidate the kinetic mechanism of processivity, we measured the rate of product release from the double-headed myosin V-HMM using a new ATP analogue, 3'-(7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carbonylamino)-3'-deoxy-ATP (deac-aminoATP), which undergoes a 20-fold increase in fluorescence emission intensity when bound to the active site of myosin V (Forgacs, E., Cartwright, S., Kovacs, M., Sakamoto, T., Sellers, J.

These used either deac-aminoATP as the substrate with ADP or ATP chase or alternatively ATP as the substrate with either a deac-aminoADP or deac-aminoATP chase. Both sets of experiments show that the observed rate of ADP or deac-aminoADP dissociation from the trail head of actomyosin V-HMM is the same as from actomyosin V-S1. The dissociation of ADP from the lead head is decreased by up to 250-fold."

With this approach, the individual heads of a single myosin V molecule were observed taking 72-nm steps as they alternated positions on the actin filament during processive movement. In addition, the heads were separated by 36 nm during pauses in motion, suggesting attachment to actin along its helical repeat. The 36-nm interhead spacing, the 72-nm step size, and the observation that heads alternate between leading and trailing positions on actin are obvious predictions of the hand-over-hand model, thus confirming myosin V's mode of walking along an actin filament."

The leading neck swings unidirectionally forward, whereas the trailing neck, once lifted, undergoes extensive Brownian rotation in all directions before landing on a site ahead of the leading head.

We investigated this by observing how fixed myosin-V rotates actin filaments. Actin filaments randomly rotated 90 degrees both clockwise and counter-clockwise during each step. Furthermore, ATP-dependent rotations were regularly followed by ATP-independent ones. Kinetic analysis indicated that the two 90 degrees rotations relate to the coordinated unbinding and rebinding of the heads with actin. We propose a 'brownian rotation hand-over-hand' model, in which myosin-V randomly rotates by thermally twisting its elastic neck domains during the 36-nm step. The brownian rotation may be advantageous for cargo transport through a crowded actin meshwork and for carrying cargoes reliably via multiple myosin-V molecules in the cell."

Melanophores aggregate or disperse their melanosomes when the host needs to change its color in response to the environment (e.g., camouflage or social interactions). Melanosome transport in cultured Xenopus melanophores is mediated by myosin V, heterotrimeric kinesin-2, and cytoplasmic dynein. Here, we describe a technique for tracking individual motors of each type, both individually and in their interaction, with high spatial (approximately 2 nm) and temporal (approximately 1 msec) localization accuracy. This method enabled us to observe (i) stepwise movement of kinesin-2 with an average step size of 8 nm; (ii) smoother melanosome transport (with fewer pauses), in the absence of intermediate filaments (IFs); and (iii) motors of actin filaments and microtubules working on the same cargo nearly simultaneously, indicating that a diffusive step is not needed between the two systems of transport. In concert with our previous report, our results also show that dynein-driven retrograde movement occurs in 8-nm steps. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that melanosomes carried by myosin V move 35 nm in a stepwise fashion in which the step rise-times can be as long as 80 msec. We observed 35-nm myosin V steps in melanophores containing no IFs. We find that myosin V steps occur faster in the absence of IFs, indicating that the IF network physically hinders organelle transport."

We expressed a truncated, single-headed myosin V construct that bound a single light chain to study its innate kinetics, free from constraints imposed by other regions of the molecule. The data demonstrate that unlike any previously characterized myosin a single-headed myosin V spends most of its kinetic cycle (>70%) strongly bound to actin in the presence of ATP. This kinetic tuning is accomplished by increasing several of the rates preceding strong binding to actin and concomitantly prolonging the duration of the strongly bound state by slowing the rate of ADP release. The net result is a myosin unlike any previously characterized, in that ADP release is the rate-limiting step for the actin-activated ATPase cycle. Thus, because of a number of kinetic adaptations, myosin V is tuned for processive movement on actin and will be capable of transporting cargo at lower motor densities than any other characterized myosin."

Based on the analyses of effects of ATP, ADP and 2,3-butanedione 2-monoxime (a reagent shown here to slow ADP release from actomyosin V) on the dwell time and the occurrence frequency of the main and the intermediate states, we propose that the 12-nm substep occurs after ATP binding to the bound trailing head and the 24-nm substep results from a mechanical step following the isomerization of an actomyosin-ADP state on the bound leading head. When the isomerization precedes the 12-nm substep, the 36-nm step occurs without substeps."

MV 1IQ binds actin with a K(d) = 4 microM in the presence of ATP gamma S at 50 mM KCl, which is 10-20-fold tighter than that of nonprocessive class II myosins.

The kinetics of monomeric myosin V containing a single IQ domain (MV 1IQ) differ from nonprocessive myosin II in that actin affinity is higher, phosphate release is extremely rapid, and ADP release is rate-limiting. We generated two mutants of myosin V by altering loop 2, a surface loop in the actin-binding region thought to alter actin affinity and phosphate release in myosin II, to determine the role that this loop plays in the kinetic tuning of myosin V. The loop 2 mutants altered the apparent affinity for actin (K(ATPase)) without altering the maximum ATPase rate (V(MAX)). Transient kinetic analysis determined that the rate of binding to actin, as well as the affinity for actin, was dependent on the net positive charge of loop 2, while other steps in the ATPase cycle were unchanged. The maximum rate of phosphate release was unchanged, but the affinity for actin in the M.ADP.Pi-state was dramatically altered by the mutations in loop 2. Thus, loop 2 is important for allowing myosin V to bind to actin with a relatively high affinity in the weak binding states but does not play a direct role in the product release steps. The ability to maintain a high affinity for actin in the weak binding states may prevent diffusion away from the actin filament and increase the degree of processive motion of myosin V."

First, a motor domain structure demonstrates that nucleotide-free myosin V adopts a specific state (rigor-like) that is not influenced by crystal packing. A second structure reveals an actomyosin state that favors rapid release of ADP, and differs from the rigor-like state by a P-loop rearrangement. Comparison of these structures with a third structure, a 2.0 angstroms resolution structure of the motor bound to an ATP analog, illuminates the structural features that provide communication between the actin interface and nucleotide-binding site. Paramount among these is a region we name the transducer, which is composed of the seven-stranded beta-sheet and associated loops and linkers.

The LCBD of myosin V consists of six tandem IQ motifs, which constitute the binding sites for calmodulin (CaM) and CaM-like light chains. Here, we report the 2-A resolution crystal structure of myosin light chain 1 (Mlc1p) bound to the IQ2-IQ3 fragment of Myo2p, a myosin V from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This structure, combined with FRET distance measurements between probes in various CaM-IQ complexes, comparative sequence analysis, and the previously determined structures of Mlc1p-IQ2 and Mlc1p-IQ4, allowed building a model of the LCBD of myosin V. The IQs of myosin V are distributed into three pairs. There appear to be specific cooperative interactions between light chains within each IQ pair, but little or no interaction between pairs, providing flexibility at their junctions. The second and third IQ pairs each present a light chain, whether CaM or a CaM-related molecule, bound in a noncanonical extended conformation in which the N-lobe does not interact with the IQ motif. The resulting free N-lobes may engage in protein-protein interactions. The extended conformation is characteristic of the single IQ of myosin VI and is common throughout the myosin superfamily.

Here we report three-dimensional measurements of the structural dynamics of the light chain domain of brain myosin V using a single-molecule fluorescence polarization technique that determines the orientation of individual protein domains with 20-40-ms time resolution. Single fluorescent calmodulin light chains tilted back and forth between two well-defined angles as the myosin molecule processively translocated along actin. The results provide evidence for lever arm rotation of the calmodulin-binding domain in myosin V, and support a 'hand-over-hand' mechanism for the translocation of double-headed myosin V molecules along actin filaments. The technique is applicable to the study of real-time structural changes in other biological systems."

The most widely used phylogenetic trees describing the evolution of all organisms have been constructed based on single-gene phylogenies that, however, often produce conflicting results. Incongruence between phylogenetic trees can result from the violation of the orthology assumption and stochastic and systematic errors. RESULTS: Here, we have reconstructed the tree of eukaryotic life based on the analysis of 2,269 myosin motor domains from 328 organisms. All sequences were manually annotated and verified, and were grouped into 35 myosin classes, of which 16 have not been proposed previously. The resultant phylogenetic tree confirms some accepted relationships of major taxa and resolves disputed and preliminary classifications. We place the Viridiplantae after the separation of Euglenozoa, Alveolata, and Stramenopiles, we suggest a monophyletic origin of Entamoebidae, Acanthamoebidae, and Dictyosteliida, and provide evidence for the asynchronous evolution of the Mammalia and Fungi. CONCLUSION: Our analysis of the myosins allowed combining phylogenetic information derived from class-specific trees with the information of myosin class evolution and distribution. This approach is expected to result in superior accuracy compared to single-gene or phylogenomic analyses because the orthology problem is resolved and a strong determinant not depending on any technical uncertainties is incorporated, the class distribution. Combining our analysis of the myosins with high quality analyses of other protein families, for example, that of the kinesins, could help in resolving still questionable dependencies at the origin of eukaryotic life."

Based on its function and biochemistry, it has been suggested that myosin-V may be a processive motor like kinesin. Processivity means that the motor undergoes multiple catalytic cycles and coupled mechanical advances for each diffusional encounter with its track. This allows single motors to support movement of an organelle along its track. Here we provide direct evidence that myosin-V is indeed a processive actin-based motor that can move in large steps approximating the 36-nm pseudo-repeat of the actin filament."

Understanding the extent to which individual light chain isoforms contribute to the kinetic behavior of myosin V is of critical importance, since it is unclear which light chains are bound to myosin V in cells. In addition, all studies to date have used alpha-skeletal muscle actin, whereas myosin V is in nonmuscle cells expressing beta- and gamma-actin. Therefore, we characterized the actin and light chain dependence of single-headed myosin V kinetics. The maximum actin-activated steady-state ATPase rate (V(max)) of a myosin V construct consisting of the motor domain and first light chain binding domain is the same when either of two essential light chain isoforms or calmodulin is bound. However, with bound calmodulin, the K(ATPase) is significantly higher and there is a reduction in the rate and equilibrium constants for ATP hydrolysis, indicating that the essential light chain favors formation of the M. ADP.P(i) state. No kinetic parameters of myosin V are strongly influenced by the actin isoform. ADP release from the actin-myosin complex is the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle with all actin and light chain isoforms. We postulate that although there are significant light-chain-dependent alterations in the kinetics that could affect myosin V processivity in in vitro assays, these differences likely are minimized under physiological conditions."

Under standard assay conditions, ADP competes with ATP, resulting in product inhibition of the ATPase rate. This presents technical problems in analyzing and interpreting the kinetics of myosin V and likely of other members of the myosin family with high ADP affinities."

The actin-activated ATPase activity of all constructs except M5IQ1 was inhibited above pCa 5, but this inhibition was completely reversed by addition of exogenous calmodulin. At the same Ca(2+) concentration, 2 mol of calmodulin from SHM5 and DHM5 or 1 mol of calmodulin from M5IQ2 were dissociated, suggesting that the inhibition of the ATPase activity is due to dissociation of calmodulin from the heavy chain. However, the motility activity of DHM5 and M5IQ2 was completely inhibited at pCa 6, where no dissociation of calmodulin was detected. Inhibition of the motility activity was not reversed by the addition of exogenous calmodulin. These results indicate that inhibition of the motility is due to conformational changes of calmodulin upon the Ca(2+) binding to the high affinity site but is not due to dissociation of calmodulin from the heavy chain."

While myosin Va has been studied well, little is known about the function of other myosin V isoforms (Vb and Vc) at a molecular level. Here we report the mechanoenzymatic function of human myosin Vb (HuM5B) for the first time. Electron microscopic observation showed that HuM5B has a double-headed structure with a long neck like myosin Va. V(max) and K(actin) of the actin-activated ATPase activity of HuM5B were 9.7 +/- 0.4 s(-)(1) and 8.5 +/- 0.1 microM, respectively. K(actin) and K(ATP) of the actin-activated ATPase activity were significantly higher than those of myosin Va. ADP markedly inhibited the ATPase activity. The rate of release of ADP from acto-HuM5B was 12.2 +/- 0.5 s(-)(1), which was comparable to the V(max) of the actin-activated ATPase activity. These results suggest that ADP release is the rate-limiting step for the actin-activated ATPase cycle; thus, HuM5B is a high duty ratio myosin. Consistently, the actin gliding velocity (0.22 +/- 0.03 microm/s) remained constant at a low motor density. The actin filament landing assay revealed that a single HuM5B molecule is sufficient to move the actin filament continuously, indicating that HuM5b is a processive motor."

L., Tyska, M. J., Novick, P. J., and Mooseker, M. S. (2001) J. Cell Biol. 153, 1121-1126). Surprisingly a chimera containing the yeast motor domain on the neck and rod of mouse myosin V (Y-MD) showed longer run lengths than mouse wild type at low salt. Run lengths of mouse myosin V showed little salt dependence, whereas those of Y-MD decreased steeply with ionic strength, similar to a chimera containing yeast loop 2 in the mouse myosin V backbone. Loop 2 binds to acidic patches on actin in the weak binding states of the cycle (Volkmann, N., Liu, H., Hazelwood, L., Krementsova, E. B., Lowey, S., Trybus, K. M., and Hanein, D. (2005) Mol. Cell 19, 595-605). Constructs containing yeast loop 2, which has no net charge compared with +6 for wild type, showed a higher K(m) for actin in steady-state ATPase assays. The results imply that a positively charged loop 2 and a high affinity for actin are important to maintain processivity near physiologic ionic strength."

The net charge of loop 2, a surface loop implicated in the initial weak binding between myosin and actin, was increased or decreased to correspondingly change the affinity of myosin V for actin in the weak binding state, without changing the velocity of movement. Processive run lengths of single molecules were determined by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Reducing the net positive charge of loop 2 significantly decreased both the affinity of myosin V for actin and the processive run length. Conversely, the addition of positive charge to loop 2 increased actin affinity and processive run length. We hypothesize that a high affinity for actin allows the detached head of a stepping myosin V to find its next actin binding site more quickly, thus decreasing the probability of run termination."

The BNM results clearly illustrated that the large-scale conformational transitions implicated in the functional cycles of the two motor systems can be largely captured with a small number of low-frequency normal modes. Therefore, the results support the idea that structural flexibility is an essential part of the construction principle of molecular motors through evolution. Such a feature is expected to be more prevalent in motor proteins than in simpler systems (e.g., signal transduction proteins) because in the former, large-scale conformational transitions often have to occur before the chemical events (e.g., ATP hydrolysis in myosin and ATP binding/phosphorylation in Ca(2+)-ATPase). This highlights the importance of Brownian motions associated with the protein domains that are involved in the functional transitions; in this sense, Brownian molecular machines is an appropriate description of molecular motors, although the normal mode results do not address the origin of the ratchet effect. The results also suggest that it might be more appropriate to describe functional transitions in some molecular motors as intrinsic elastic motions modulating local structural changes in the active site, which in turn gets stabilized by the subsequent chemical events, in contrast with the conventional idea of local changes somehow getting amplified into larger-scale motions. In the case of myosin, for example, we favor the idea that Brownian motions associated with the flexible converter propagates to the Switch I/II region, where the salt-bridge formation gets stabilized by ATP hydrolysis, in contrast with the textbook notion that ATP hydrolysis drives the converter motion. Another useful aspect of the BNM results is that selected low-frequency normal modes have been identified to form a set of collective coordinates that can be used to characterize the progress of a significant fraction of large-scale conformational transitions. Therefore, the present normal mode analysis has provided a stepping-stone toward more elaborate microscopic simulations for addressing critical issues in free energy conversions in molecular machines, such as the coupling and the causal relationship between collective motions and essential local changes at the catalytic active site where ATP hydrolysis occurs."

In the simplest case the fluctuating movements of a motor enzyme are well described by a diffusion process on a two-dimensional potential energy surface, where one dimension is a chemical reaction coordinate and the other is the spatial displacement of the motor. The coupling between chemistry and motion results from the shape of the surface, and motor velocities and forces result from diffusion currents on this surface. This microscopic description is shown to possess an equivalent kinetic mechanism in which the rate constants depend on externally applied forces. By using this equivalence we explore the characteristic properties of several broad classes of motor mechanisms and give general expressions for motor velocity versus load force for any member of each class. We show that in some cases simple plots of 1/velocity vs. 1/concentration can distinguish between classes of motor mechanisms and may be used to determine the step at which movement occurs."

This highlights the importance of Brownian motions associated with the protein domains that are involved in the functional transitions; in this sense, Brownian molecular machines is an appropriate description of molecular motors, although the normal mode results do not address the origin of the ratchet effect. The results also suggest that it might be more appropriate to describe functional transitions in some molecular motors as intrinsic elastic motions modulating local structural changes in the active site, which in turn gets stabilized by the subsequent chemical events, in contrast with the conventional idea of local changes somehow getting amplified into larger-scale motions. In the case of myosin, for example, we favor the idea that Brownian motions associated with the flexible converter propagates to the Switch I/II region, where the salt-bridge formation gets stabilized by ATP hydrolysis, in contrast with the textbook notion that ATP hydrolysis drives the converter motion. Another useful aspect of the BNM results is that selected low-frequency normal modes have been identified to form a set of collective coordinates that can be used to characterize the progress of a significant fraction of large-scale conformational transitions. Therefore, the present normal mode analysis has provided a stepping-stone toward more elaborate microscopic simulations for addressing critical issues in free energy conversions in molecular machines, such as the coupling and the causal relationship between collective motions and essential local changes at the catalytic active site where ATP hydrolysis occurs."

In the simplest case the fluctuating movements of a motor enzyme are well described by a diffusion process on a two-dimensional potential energy surface, where one dimension is a chemical reaction coordinate and the other is the spatial displacement of the motor. The coupling between chemistry and motion results from the shape of the surface, and motor velocities and forces result from diffusion currents on this surface. This microscopic description is shown to possess an equivalent kinetic mechanism in which the rate constants depend on externally applied forces. By using this equivalence we explore the characteristic properties of several broad classes of motor mechanisms and give general expressions for motor velocity versus load force for any member of each class. We show that in some cases simple plots of 1/velocity vs. 1/concentration can distinguish between classes of motor mechanisms and may be used to determine the step at which movement occurs."

Compared with run-length data, our model provides strong support for a proposed strain-controlled gating mechanism that enhances processivity. We demonstrate that the diffusion rate of a detached motor head during motor stepping is self-consistent with known kinetic rate constants and can explain the motor's key performance features, such as speed and stall force. We present illustrative and realistic animations of motor stepping in the presence of thermal noise. The quantitative success and illustrative power of this type of model suggest that it will be useful in testing our understanding of a range of biological and synthetic motors."

Based on kinetic and structural considerations, we assert that three crystal forms of the myosin V motor delineate the conformational changes that myosin motors undergo upon detachment from actin. First, a motor domain structure demonstrates that nucleotide-free myosin V adopts a specific state (rigor-like) that is not influenced by crystal packing. A second structure reveals an actomyosin state that favors rapid release of ADP, and differs from the rigor-like state by a P-loop rearrangement. Comparison of these structures with a third structure, a 2.0 angstroms resolution structure of the motor bound to an ATP analog, illuminates the structural features that provide communication between the actin interface and nucleotide-binding site. Paramount among these is a region we name the transducer, which is composed of the seven-stranded beta-sheet and associated loops and linkers. Reminiscent of the beta-sheet distortion of the F1-ATPase, sequential distortion of this transducer region likely controls sequential release of products from the nucleotide pocket during force generation."

Each class of motor has different properties, but in the cell they often function together. In this review we summarize what is known about their single-molecule properties and the possibilities for regulation of such properties. In view of new results on cytoplasmic dynein, we attempt to rationalize how these different classes of motors might work together as part of the intracellular transport machinery. We propose that kinesin and myosin are robust and highly efficient transporters, but with somewhat limited room for regulation of function. Because cytoplasmic dynein is less efficient and robust, to achieve function comparable to the other motors it requires a number of accessory proteins as well as multiple dyneins functioning together. This necessity for additional factors, as well as dynein's inherent complexity, in principle allows for greatly increased control of function by taking the factors away either singly or in combination. Thus, dynein's contribution relative to the other motors can be dynamically tuned, allowing the motors to function together differently in a variety of situations."

These differences can be understood in terms of the 'duty ratio', the fraction of the time that a motor is attached to its filament.

On a macroscopic scale, animals and microbes have to be able to move towards food and away from poison and predators. Plants turn their leaves toward their energy source, the sunlight. But even on a molecular scale, movement is essential for life. It has been known for a long time that enzymes and proteins undergo large conformational changes while performing their biological tasks. The catalytically active regions of enzymes need to sequentially open to bind their respective substrates and close to allow the specific chemical reaction to occur in a defined chemical environment. The active sites finally open up again up to allow the product to be released. Molecular motors are proteins and protein complexes that have evolved in living cells to carry out a variety of functions essential for survival, reproduction and differentiation of the cells and organisms. They use chemical, electrochemical or potential energy and transduce that energy into physical, chemical or mechanical force. In this paper we review some of the molecular motors that were designed by nature to either perform physical work or that contain motor-like movements as part of their catalytic mechanism."

The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group C2221 where a = 84.50 A, b = 145.4 A, and c = 152.8 A. The conformation of the protein is similar to that of MgADP.AlF4.SlDc [Fisher, A.J., et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 8960-8972]. The nucleotide binding site contains a complex between MgADP and vanadate where MgADP exhibits a very similar conformation to that seen in previous complexes. The vanadate ion adopts a trigonal bipyramidal coordination. The three equatorial oxygen ligands are fairly short, average 1.7 A, relative to a single bond distance of approximately 1.8 A and are coordinated to the magnesium ion, N zeta of Lys 185, and five other protein ligands. The apical coordination to the vanadate ion is filled by a terminal oxygen on the beta-phosphate of ADP and a water molecule at bond distances of 2.1 and 2.3 A, respectively. The long length of the apical bonds suggests that the bond order is considerably less than unity. This structure confirms the earlier suggestion that vanadate is a model for the transition state of ATP hydrolysis and thus provides insight into those factors that are responsible for catalysis. In particular, it shows that the protein ligands and water structure surrounding the gamma-phosphate pocket are oriented to stabilize a water molecule in an appropriate position for in-line nucleophilic attack on the gamma-phosphorus of ATP. This structure reveals also an orientation of the COOH-terminal region beyond Thr 688 which is very different from that observed in either MgADP.BeFx.SlDc or chicken skeletal myosin subfragment 1. This is consistent with the COOH-terminal region of the molecule playing an important role in the transduction of chemical energy of hydrolysis of ATP into mechanical movement."

The structure reveals only minor differences in the motor domain from that in plus-end directed myosins, with the exception of two unique inserts. The first is near the nucleotide-binding pocket and alters the rates of nucleotide association and dissociation. The second unique insert forms an integral part of the myosin VI converter domain along with a calmodulin bound to a novel target motif within the insert. This serves to redirect the effective 'lever arm' of myosin VI, which includes a second calmodulin bound to an 'IQ motif', towards the pointed (minus) end of the actin filament. This repositioning largely accounts for the reverse directionality of this class of myosin motors. We propose a model incorporating a kinesin-like uncoupling/docking mechanism to provide a full explanation of the movements of myosin VI."

The structure of myosin is known, but the actin-binding site is not well defined, and the mechanisms by which actin activates ATP hydrolysis by myosin, and myosin moves relative to the actin filament, developing force, are not fully understood. Previous phylogenetic analyses of the motor domain of myosins have identified up to twelve classes. We set out to analyse the positions of conserved residues within this domain in detail, and relate the conserved residues to the myosin structure. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that there are at least thirteen myosin classes. Conserved residues in the motor domain have been positioned within the framework provided by the recent crystal structures, thus helping to define those residues involved in actin and ATP binding, in hydrolysis and in conformational change. This has revealed remarkably poor overall conservation at the site thought to be involved in actin binding, but several highly conserved residues have been identified that may be functionally important. CONCLUSIONS: Information from such a sequence analysis is a useful tool in the further interpretation of X-ray structures. It allows the position of crucial residues from other members of a superfamily to be determined within the framework provided by the known structures and the functional significance of conserved or mutated residues to be assessed."

The attachment and detachment of the cross-bridge are determined by modeling the electrostatic attraction between the cross-bridge and the fiber binding sites, so that binding depends on the strain in the cross-bridge and its velocity with respect to the fiber. The model correctly predicts the empirical force-velocity characteristics for populations of motor molecules. For a single motor, the apparent cross-bridge step size per ATP hydrolysis depends nonlinearly on the load. When the elastic energy driving the cross-bridge is generated by a conformational change, the velocity and duty cycle are much larger than is observed experimentally for myosin."
