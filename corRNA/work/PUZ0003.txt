Challenge 3 (November 2011)
A domain of a riboswitch was crystallized. The sequence is the following:
5'-CUCUGGAGAGAACCGUUUAAUCGGUCGCCGAAGGAGCAAGCU    CUGCGCAUAUGCAGAGUGAAACUCUCAGGCAAAAGGACAGAG-3'
The crystallized sequence was slightly different (an apical loop was replaced by a GAAA loop) but it was not mentioned to protect the crystallographers.
