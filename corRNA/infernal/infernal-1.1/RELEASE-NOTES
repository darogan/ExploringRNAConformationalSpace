________________________________________________________________

This is the first official release of Infernal 1.1. 

Infernal 1.1 has been in testing since June 2011. It is now ready for
production use. It has been stable for many months and is already
deployed in its release candidate versions for Rfam and by several
other power users. 

There is only one small difference between 1.1 and the previous 1.1rc4
release, a bug fix involving calibration of very large models:

 - #i40: cmcalibrate: fails on very large models (only observed for 
         eukaryotic LSU rRNA models).
